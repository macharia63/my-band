# DAVID AND THE GIANTS

My project focuses on the popular rock band which started in 1963 in Laurel, Mississippi. This website is for their fans, upcoming artists and companies who would like to invite them to perfome in gigs, weddings, charities and gatherings.
The application is live here [ https://macharia63.github.io/my-band/]( https://macharia63.github.io/my-band/).

My project describes what the band is all about,what kind of songs they sings, where they perform, how to buy their music and how contact them as an individual or company.
